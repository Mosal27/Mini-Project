# React Shopping To-Do List 

This project is a React-based to-do list application that demonstrates various key concepts in React development as part of a mini-project 5.

## Objectives and Implementation
- Integrate a React front-end with a Node.js back-end: The application is set up as a front-end project in React. 

- Understand JSX Syntax: Utilized in all components, specifically seen in ToDoList.js.

- Create Functional and Class Components: This application uses functional components (ToDoList).

- Utilize Props and State: Demonstrated in ToDoList.js through the use of the useState hook for managing task data.

- Implement Event Handling: Event handling implemented in handleSubmit and markAsCompleted functions in ToDoList.js.

- Use Conditional Rendering: Displaying a message when no tasks are available in ToDoList.js.

- Render Lists and Keys: Tasks are rendered as a list, with each item having a unique key, in ToDoList.js.
